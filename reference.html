<p class="dropcap">Stunning: If you are in a situation where you can use some ‘financial help. This will probably be the life-changing article you’ve been waiting for. The article shows exactly how an immigrant from Shanghai acquired $1,34 MLN in 1,5 year time.</p>

<p>The story is about twenty-nine year old Zhang Wei who is now living in a comfortable apartment in Upper West Side - New York. In 2019 he came to the United States because the future of his family was far from hopeful. His mom died in 2017 and his dad was without a job ever since.
</p>

<p><b>Zhang Wei explains:</b> <i>“My situation forced me to do this. Desperate times need desperate measures they say. I had a cousin who lived in a suburb in New York. With $2,000 worth of savings I went to New York. I didn’t expect much, then I didn’t know I had to adjust my expectations very soon.”</i>
</p>

<p><i>“The first days I didn’t feel like going out and my cousin had to work. So I started scrolling on Facebook. There I discovered secret groups that talked about the fortunes they made with an online system. I was intrigued and the following days I checked all their messages.”</i></p>

<h3><i>”When one user made $6,726 in 2 weeks time I was convinced.”</i></h3>

<p>“It blew my mind how easily people were making money. With no technical or financial background. People from different nationalities, male or female, it didn’t care. When one user made $6,726 in 2 weeks time I was convinced.”</p>

<p>“After my expenses to fly to New York and to stay with my cousin I still had $1,200. I realized it was time to let the money work for me and got in with only $47. What happened then surpassed my wildest dreams.”</p>

<p>“The first hours I watched my account closely and soon the system made the cash for me. It went up to $182, $256 and then even $323. At that point my total profit was already $276 in just 4 hours. At that point it was already 2am so I went to bed but actually I was too excited to sleep.”</p>

<p>“When I checked my account early in the morning it showed: <b>‘$673,23’</b> was this really true? I checked with my account manager and he confirmed right away. He even let me cash out $500 to show me it’s really my money. I couldn’t believe my eyes when the money reached my account 2 hours later.”
</p>



<div class="results"> <img src="img/chick1.jpg" width="600">
<p class="bold">“From coming to the United States to having $15,400 on my account in 2 weeks”</p>
</div>


<p>“This went on for weeks and even months. Within a week I reached the $5,000 and within a month I was already on $31,788. The best thing is that I didn’t have to do much. Per day I checked it for 10 minutes maximum. It gave me a lot of time to explore New York and the country.”</p>

<p>“It went on for months until I hit the $1,3 MLN last week. I cashed out everything. Money on such an account is nice but it was time to enjoy and do the right things with it. Next week I fly in my entire family to the United States and we will do a trip trough the country together. I can now even fix my American citizenship easily with all the money that got in.”</p>

<p>“Now I help my friends and family with these accounts as well. Just to make sure every single person with a phone or laptop can accomplish a lot and take care of his loved ones.”</p>

<h2>But what exactly is Zhang talking about?</h2>

<p>Zhang was able to collect that extra money thanks to an online system that has been quietly making a few ordinary Americans wealthy for decades.

<p>A source from a leading consultancy stated: “<i>This is now creating many more weekly millionaires than the lottery. In fact, we are seeing 90% of new clients seeking wealth advice now earn their main income with it. What is astounding is that many of these people were working in regular jobs, like construction, office jobs and even unemployed and now they are earning more than top CEO's in London, New York or Tokyo.</i>”</p>

<p>After extensive research we from The Daily News were blown away by the results. </p>

<p>Experts call it “<i>Profit Point</i>”.</p>

<p>It's the fastest cash producing machine in history. It's highly likely you'll see more about it's fundamentals on CNN, NBC, and Fox and you might read about it in USA today, Time, Fortune and your local newspaper. <p>

<p>It started back in the 1990s and since then rich bankers and other members of the 1% have literally made billions and billions of dollars out of thin air and it is 100 times more effective than starting a business. No hassles, no "employees", no selling at all.</p>

<p>We learnt that Profit Point makes money through a new app that is automatically generating revenue for you, but more about this later.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, 9 out of 10 Americans have never heard about it. We're not talking about difficult platforms or anything complicated like that... This system is so simple that you can use it even if you know nothing about making money online... Even if you’ve never invested in your life.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>You do NOT need to know anything about finance (in fact, the less you know, the better. since you won't be biased);</li>

<li>You do NOT need to know anything about technology;</li>

<li>You do NOT need a lot of money;</li>

<li>And you do NOT need a lot of free time;</li>
</ul>

<p>What you do need to know is that you can simply start by transferring less than $50 and rake in profits with the click of your mouse.</p>

<p>Anyone can learn to master this in no time. You don’t need any prior investing experience or business background. You don’t need a college degree. You don’t need to be good at math either. There is no hard work involved and it's basically auto-pilot.</P>

<p>There is no guesswork or ‘luck’ required. Once you get going, it only takes a few hours a week to do everything.
And you can do it all at home, or wherever you want, while you’re doing other things, too!</p>

<p>Here’s what’s even more astounding: a normal app costs you money when you buy it but this app which is connected to a website is generating traffic on your website which will generate revenue for you automatically.</p>

<div class="results"> <img src="img/gains.gif" width="600">
<p class="bold"> <i>These ‘visitors’ could bring you easily $500+ per day and later on even over $1500."</i>  </p></div>

<p>That is an average of 44x your money! That’s enough to turn your $47 into $46,400...  in just weeks.</p>

<p>Sounds to good to be true? That's what these ordinary Americans initially thought too:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>Ethan Jones (45), for example, made a small fortune of $35.456,20 with ZERO prior investing experience';</li>
<li>Chloe Finman became a few hundred thousands dollars richer at the age of 24, starting with $70 fund from her father;</li>
<li>Charlie Shrem had over 300,000 dollars sitting in the bank at the age of 27, saying "Life is GREAT";</li>
<li>Evie Brown's net worth went up with FIVE FIGURES within weeks!</li>
</ul>

<div class="results"> <img src="img/checks.gif" width="600">
<p class="bold"> <i>"They all made A LOT of money by buying the product for only $47..."</i>  </p></div>

<p>Before we continue we have to warn you. The financial elite are deathly afraid more Americans are jumping on this. It’s already pissed off several very powerful banks. Big firms are out for blood because the’re loosing millions and  together with  the goverments they will do everything within their powers to BAN this method from the the United States and prevent more ‘working-class’ citizens from getting rich overnight.  </p>

<h2>PROOF: One of our readers turned $50 into $58.257</h2>

<p>Naturally, you might be sceptical that something so simple could be so profitable. That’s why the editors from our magazine decided to put this system to the test – and our skeptics were completely blown away.</p>

<p>It wasn’t hard to find a volunteer. Our inbox flooded with requests and we finally picked Liao Shui as the lucky one. He is a 42 year old father and lives in New York together with his wife. As a mechanic he has always been able to pay the bills, but was never able to take his family on a well deserved exotic holiday. And without having any computer skills, degrees or knowledge about how the financial markets work he would be our perfect fit for the test. </p>

<p class="bold">Liao Shui 5 Days After Joining: "I Couldn't Believe My Eyes, No Learning Needed, Almost No Work Required"</p>
</div>

<p class="bold week">Day 1:</p>
<p>“The first thing I did was buying the <b>Profit Point</b> product for $47. It took me about 2 minutes to enter my name, email, phone-number and password. </p>

<p>I felt great excitement about starting to let the product make huge money for me.”</p>

<p class="bold week">Day 2:</p>
<p>On day two, I woke up and rushed to work. I had slept in and was going to be late for my train. When I got to the office, I checked my emails and drank my coffee. Then, I remembered, I forgot to check my account! It was already 10:45am, so it was almost 12 hours since I placed it. I logged into the site, feeling nervous and excited. Would my funds still be there? I felt a little anxious…</p>

<p>I opened the dashboard of the site. I thought at first I had made a mistake. Was this my account? I double checked the account name in the corner, yes it was mine. At that point, I almost spilled my coffee! I could see that my new balance at that time was $334.53. Incredible! In only 12 hours, while I was sleeping, the account made $296.47 profit from the $47 that I had funded. I’m glad I remembered to make a screenshot of it, so you can see below what I saw that morning. I wrote to my account personal mentor. Amazingly, he was not as surprised as I was. “This is normal” he said, “in fact, we often see people earning more than that in the first 12 hours”. I was impressed, this thing was really working. For the rest of the day, I could hardly concentrate on my job.</p>


<div class="results"> <img src="img/profits.jpg" height="342" width="100%">
<p class="bold">Liao's account balance after one day...</p>
</div>


<p class="bold week">Day 3:</p>
<p>“On day three I was really getting into it. I could see that this wasn’t some sort of complicated system. This was easy and not only that, it was very clear how I was earning so much money. I finally understood why famous billionaires called this a new economy: 100 times more powerful than anything else I had ever imagined. Before I wen to sleep that night my wallet showed me an asthonishing $2,453.” </p>

<p class="bold week">Day 4:</p>
<p>“Today, things really took off. My account manager at <b>Profit Point</b> explained that the more money I made, the more I could potentially earn. The end of day balance was an astounding $3,785. This was much more than I earn in a year. In just 4 remarkable days, I had earned enough to travel with my wife, first class! She didn’t even know about my success yet. I booked a table at a 5 star hotel for the weekend to tell her about this amazing story. This money was going to change our lives.”  </p>

<p class="bold week">Day 5:</p>
<p>“first thing I did was I checked my stats on my phone. I didn’t need to worry about rushing for the train, because I had already arranged for a limo to collect me that morning. Sure, the cost would be high, but I wanted to see the look on my boss’s face when I pulled up at our office in a sleek black stretch limo! I felt like Gordon Gecko in the movie “Wall St.” and it was so much fun. I decided that I didn’t want to spend every day working for minimum wage when I could earn so much working from home (if you could call it working!). I quit my job and gave a huge gift basket for all my friends in the office. Some people thought maybe I had won the lottery. I didn’t tell them about my secret. I wanted to wait and reveal it first to my beloved.”</p>

<p class="bold week">Day 6:</p>
<p>“This is the last day of journal. It's a Sunday and our 'family day', so I'm not working. Luckily my balance keeps growing, even today. It doesn't matter if I spend time with my family or do something else, everyday the markets are open I'll be making profits. My total balance right now is $8.257 and it just keeps growing. </p>

<p>“I decided to withdraw $5.000 to my savings account. Within 5 minutes the bank manager called wondering how I could earn this kind of money. When I told him I got access to Profit Point he told me I wasn't the first one who made huge sums of cash using this and invited me to talk about investment opportunities.</p>

<p>Barely three weeks ago I couldn't get a mortgage and now the bank invited me to a private business event. Incredible how fast times can change..”</p>

<h2>How Can I Get Started?</h2>

<p>As long as you have access to a computer, mobile phone or tablet with an internet connection you can get started. And you can do it on your preferred schedule too. Whether it's 5 hours a week or 50 hours when you have access you can start earning commissions whenever you wish. </p>

<p>In our 20-years of experience, we haven’t ever seen anything like this, but sometimes things that seem to be ‘too good to be true’ are true. If you have any doubt or are sceptical, you have to try it for yourself. But we are 100% convinced your scepticism will be blown away seeing this tool will generate staggering profits for you.</p>

<h2>Why It’s Critical To Create Your Account Right Now</h2>

<p>You simply can’t afford to miss this boat. Profit Point Autonomy is about to go viral and still perfectly legal & ethical to use by anyone living in the USA right now.</p>

<div class="results"> <img src="img/app.jpg" width="600"></div>

<p>However, to maintain the highest standard of personal & professional attention Mason Drake has informed us that they can only handle a dozen sign-ups per day. That’s in no way to pressure you, but in order to maximize the profits per user, they simply can’t handle more.</p>

<p>As a special deal for our readers, Mason also agreed to offer Profit Point Autonomy for a limited time price of $47, instead of the regular <strike>$197</strike></u>

<p>But you have to act fast, as there are limited spots available...</p>

<p style="background-color:yellow"><strong><a href="#LINK#">Due to extremely high demand, there are only 8 spots left. Applicants will be accepted on a ‘First come, first-serve basis.’</a></strong></p>
